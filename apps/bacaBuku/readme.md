# bacaBuku

bacaBuku is the first prototype application for the BukuBuku project. This app is the main application that the user will interact when using the device. The application will handle browsing ebook files, displaying e-book, navigating the e-book, etc. Initially the app will use the following library:
- [lvgl](https://lvgl.io/)  as the graphic display.
  - lvgl seem to have a good support for touch screen, might be useful for further development down the line.
- [mupdf](https://mupdf.com/)  as the ebook parser
- Using C++17.
